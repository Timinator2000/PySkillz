# Average of $n$ Numbers

```math
\text{avg} = \frac{\text{sum of numbers}}{n}
```

# $n$th Term of Arithmetic Sequence

```math
a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d
```

# Sum of First $n$ Terms of Arithmetic Sequence

```math
S_n = \frac{n}{2}(2a_1 + (n-1)d)
```

# $n$th Term of Geometric Sequence

```math
a_n = a_1 \cdot r^{\,n-1}
```

# Sum of First $n$ Terms of Geometric Sequence

```math
S_n = \frac{a_1(1-r^n)}{1-r}, \quad r \neq 1
```
