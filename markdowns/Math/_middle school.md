✅ What you now have:

* **30 problems** (all middle-school appropriate)
* Each with: **problem statement, function, solution, test cases**
* Covers **geometry, arithmetic, sequences, conversions, applied math**

Do you want me to also prepare this in a **worksheet format** (problem text only, no answers), so you can hand it to students first before showing them the solutions?
