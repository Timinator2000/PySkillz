Good catch üëç ‚Äî if we want middle school students practicing **division earlier**, we can insert some problems that are still simple but reinforce dividing numbers. Here are **5 extra problems** (with formulas) that can slot into the **first 10 group**:

---

## Extra Division Problems

**A. Area of a Right Triangle (using division)**

```math
A = \frac{\text{base} \times \text{height}}{2}
```

**B. Average of Two Numbers**

```math
\text{avg} = \frac{a + b}{2}
```

**C. Rate (Work per Time)**

```math
\text{rate} = \frac{\text{work done}}{\text{time}}
```

**D. Unit Price (Cost per Item)**

```math
\text{unit price} = \frac{\text{total cost}}{\text{number of items}}
```

**E. Density**

```math
\text{density} = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{volume}}
```

‚úÖ These are still **middle school friendly**, but they bring division into play earlier.
‚úÖ You could **mix them into the first 10**, maybe replacing or extending so you have **15 problems in the ‚ÄúBasic Arithmetic & Numbers‚Äù section**.
