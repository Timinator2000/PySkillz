```math
V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height}
```

# Volume of a Cylinder

```math
V = \pi r^2 h
```

# Surface Area of a Cube

```math
A = 6 \times \text{side}^2
```

# Surface Area of a Rectangular Prism

```math
A = 2(lw + wh + lh)
```

# Surface Area of a Cylinder

```math
A = 2\pi r h + 2\pi r^2
```
