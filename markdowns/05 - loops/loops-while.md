Exercise 1: Keep Halving Until Small

Description:
Ask the user to enter a positive number. Keep dividing the number by 2 using a while loop until it becomes less than 1. Print each intermediate value.

Example:

Enter a number: 20
20.0
10.0
5.0
2.5
1.25
0.625


Why not easy with for?
You don’t know in advance how many steps it will take; it depends on the user’s input.




Exercise 16: Collatz Sequence

Description:
Start with a positive integer n (e.g., n = 17). Use a while loop to generate the Collatz sequence:

If n is even, divide it by 2.

If n is odd, multiply by 3 and add 1.
Stop when n becomes 1, and print the sequence.

Goal: Practice loops with dynamic conditions.
