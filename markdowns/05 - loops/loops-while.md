Exercise 1: Keep Halving Until Small

Description:
Ask the user to enter a positive number. Keep dividing the number by 2 using a while loop until it becomes less than 1. Print each intermediate value.

Example:

Enter a number: 20
20.0
10.0
5.0
2.5
1.25
0.625


Why not easy with for?
You don’t know in advance how many steps it will take; it depends on the user’s input.
