# Exercise #1: Start to Finish

Write a function that prints all integers from `start` up to and including `finish`, each on a new line.

Example:

```text
start = 1
finish = 5
```

Expected Output:

```text
1
2
3
4
5
```

# Exercise #2: Start to Finish on One Line

Write a function that prints all integers from `start` up to and including `finish`, on a single line, separated by spaces.

Example:

```text
start = 1
finish = 5
```

Expected Output:

```text
1 2 3 4 5
```

# Exercise #3: Number Triangle

Given an integer `number` between 0 and 9 inclusive, print a triangle per the example below.

Example:

```text
number = 5
```

Expected Output:

```text
1
2 2
3 3 3
4 4 4 4
5 5 5 5 5
```

# Exercise #4: Sum Numbers from Start to Finish

Create a function that returns the sum of all integers greater than or equal to `start` and less than or equal to `finish`.

Example:

```text
start = 1
finish = 5
```

Expected Return Value:

```text
15
```

# Exercise #5: Divisible by 5

Given a list of integers, iterate over the list and display the numbers which are divisible by 5. If you find a number greater than 150, stop the loop iteration immediately before printing anything more.

Example:

```text
a_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 145, 200, 300, 400]
```

Expected Output:

```text
5
145
```
