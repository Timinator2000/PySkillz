If you want, I can **also write a Python solution template for all 30 exercises** with proper loops, so learners can test and compare their solutions. This would save time and keep consistency for grading.

Do you want me to do that?



Absolutely! Let’s continue building on your loop exercises, increasing the difficulty and complexity. These next **15 exercises (31–45)** incorporate more nested loops, lists, ranges, and logic without using `input()`.

### **Intermediate → Advanced (31–45)**

31. Print a right-angled triangle of numbers, height 5:

```

These exercises continue to **increase in complexity** by introducing:

* Nested loops with alignment or combinatorics.
* Patterns with numbers and stars.
* Logical conditions using modulo and ranges.
* Introduction to sequences like Fibonacci, powers, and cubes.
* Early introduction to Pascal’s triangle and pair generation.

If you want, I can **also generate a final set of 15–20 “advanced beginner to intermediate” exercises** that include **list manipulations, break/continue, and nested loops with calculations**, so you end up with a complete set of 60 exercises.

Do you want me to do that next?



Perfect! Let’s finish the set with **advanced beginner → intermediate exercises (46–60)** that introduce **lists, break/continue, nested loops with calculations, and slightly more challenging logic**.

### **Advanced Beginner → Intermediate (46–60)**

46. Create a list of numbers 1–50 and print only the even numbers using a loop.

47. Print the sum of squares of numbers from 1 to 20.

48. Generate a list of numbers 1–30 and print numbers divisible by 3 but skip multiples of 9 using `continue`.

49. Create a list of numbers 1–20 and print the first number divisible by 7 using `break`.

50. Using a loop, generate the first 10 triangular numbers (1, 3, 6, 10, …) and print them.

51. Print a square pattern where diagonals are stars, size 5:

```
*   *
 * * 
  *  
 * * 
*   *
```

52. Generate a multiplication table for numbers 1–5 but **skip** rows where the row number is even.

53. Print the sum of all prime numbers less than 50 using a loop.

54. Create a nested loop to print all coordinate pairs `(i, j)` for `i` from 0 to 3 and `j` from 0 to 3 **excluding pairs where i = j**.

55. Print numbers from 1 to 50, replacing multiples of 4 with “Quad” and multiples of 6 with “Hex”.

56. Create a list of numbers 1–20 and print only numbers whose factorial is less than 5000.

57. Generate the first 15 numbers of the sequence: 1, 1, 2, 6, 24, … (factorials) and print them.

58. Print a right-aligned triangle of numbers from 1 to 7 like this:

```
      1
     12
    123
   1234
  12345
 123456
1234567
```

59. Print a multiplication table from 1–10 but highlight (e.g., with asterisks) all products divisible by 7.

60. Using nested loops, print all combinations of three numbers `(i, j, k)` from 1 to 4 where `i < j < k`.

---

This final set adds **more challenging logic** while staying beginner-friendly:

* Using **break/continue** effectively.
* Nested loops for coordinates and combinations.
* Summation, factorials, triangular numbers, and patterns.
* Conditional replacements and highlighting in loops.

---

If you want, I can **combine all 60 exercises into a single structured list** with **categories and increasing difficulty**, ready for a Python coding workbook or automated test.

Do you want me to do that next?
