# This is the Way to Go

Perfect üëç ‚Äî here‚Äôs the **clean factory-method version only**, all in one place so you can copy it:

```python
class Cell:
    def __init__(self, row, col):
        self.row = row
        self.col = col
        self.neighbors = {}

    def add_neighbor(self, direction, cell):
        self.neighbors[direction] = cell

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Cell({self.row},{self.col})"


class Grid:
    def __init__(self, rows, cols):
        self.rows = rows
        self.cols = cols
        self.grid = {}

        # Create cells via factory
        for r in range(rows):
            for c in range(cols):
                self.grid[(r, c)] = self.make_cell(r, c)

        # Link neighbors
        for r in range(rows):
            for c in range(cols):
                cell = self.grid[(r, c)]
                for dr, dc, name in [(-1, 0, "up"), (1, 0, "down"),
                                     (0, -1, "left"), (0, 1, "right")]:
                    nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                    if (nr, nc) in self.grid:
                        cell.add_neighbor(name, self.grid[(nr, nc)])

    def make_cell(self, row, col):
        """Factory method ‚Äî override this in subclasses."""
        return Cell(row, col)

    def __getitem__(self, pos):
        return self.grid[pos]

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Grid({self.rows}x{self.cols})"


# Example custom Cell
class SpecialCell(Cell):
    def __init__(self, row, col):
        super().__init__(row, col)
        self.value = 0

    def increment(self):
        self.value += 1


# Example custom Grid that uses SpecialCell
class SpecialGrid(Grid):
    def make_cell(self, row, col):
        return SpecialCell(row, col)


# Usage
g = SpecialGrid(3, 3)
c = g[1, 1]
print(c)          # SpecialCell(1,1)
c.increment()
print(c.value)    # 1
```

---

This way:

* `Grid` doesn‚Äôt know about `SpecialCell`.
* Subclasses just override `make_cell` ‚Äî no need to change `__init__`.
* All neighbor wiring stays in the base class.

# Diagonal Neighbors???

Do you want me to also add **diagonal neighbors** as an option in the base `Grid`, or keep it strictly up/down/left/right?



# This is Probably a No


Got it üëç ‚Äî I‚Äôll reconstruct the whole conversation we had about the **grid and cell class architecture** from the beginning. Here‚Äôs the full flow of what we discussed:

---

### 1. The setup you described

You said you had:

* A **`Grid` class**, which keeps `self.grid` as a dictionary where keys are `(row, col)` tuples and values are `Cell` objects.
* A **`Cell` class**, where each cell keeps pointers to its neighbors.
* The `Grid` constructor builds all the cells and wires up neighbors.

But you wanted the design to be reusable, so that for special applications you could subclass `Grid` and have it use a custom `Cell` subclass (e.g. `SpecialCell`) without rewriting the neighbor-linking logic.

---

### 2. The flexible design

I suggested making the base `Grid` class accept a **cell factory** (or class reference) so it knows what kind of `Cell` to build. That way, subclasses of `Grid` can override the cell type.

Here‚Äôs the reconstructed code:

```python
class Cell:
    def __init__(self, row, col):
        self.row = row
        self.col = col
        self.neighbors = {}

    def add_neighbor(self, direction, cell):
        self.neighbors[direction] = cell

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Cell({self.row},{self.col})"


class Grid:
    def __init__(self, rows, cols, cell_cls=Cell):
        self.rows = rows
        self.cols = cols
        self.cell_cls = cell_cls
        self.grid = {}

        # Create cells
        for r in range(rows):
            for c in range(cols):
                self.grid[(r, c)] = self.cell_cls(r, c)

        # Link neighbors
        for r in range(rows):
            for c in range(cols):
                cell = self.grid[(r, c)]
                for dr, dc, name in [(-1, 0, "up"), (1, 0, "down"),
                                     (0, -1, "left"), (0, 1, "right")]:
                    nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                    if (nr, nc) in self.grid:
                        cell.add_neighbor(name, self.grid[(nr, nc)])

    def __getitem__(self, pos):
        return self.grid[pos]

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Grid({self.rows}x{self.cols})"
```

---

### 3. Subclassing with custom cells

You can now make a custom `Cell` and a specialized `Grid` like this:

```python
class SpecialCell(Cell):
    def __init__(self, row, col):
        super().__init__(row, col)
        self.value = 0  # extra property

    def increment(self):
        self.value += 1


class SpecialGrid(Grid):
    def __init__(self, rows, cols):
        super().__init__(rows, cols, cell_cls=SpecialCell)
```

Usage:

```python
g = SpecialGrid(3, 3)
c = g[1, 1]
print(c)          # SpecialCell at (1,1)
print(c.neighbors)  # has up/down/left/right
c.increment()
print(c.value)    # 1
```

---

### 4. Key takeaway

* `Grid` doesn‚Äôt need to know about `SpecialCell`.
* You just tell it which class to use for cells (`cell_cls=...`).
* Subclasses of `Grid` can enforce a certain cell type.

---

Do you want me to also include the \*\*variant we discussed where Grid automatically detects the right `Cell` subclass from `self.__class__` (no need to pass `cell_cls` explicitly in `__init__`)?





Nice üòÉ ‚Äî now we‚Äôre talking about **heterogeneous grids**, where different positions may have different types of `Cell`.

There are two clean ways to do this:

---

## 1. Pass a **cell factory function**

Instead of just passing a class, let the `Grid` take a function that returns a cell. This function can decide *per row,col* which subclass to use.

```python
class Grid:
    def __init__(self, rows, cols, cell_factory=None):
        self.rows = rows
        self.cols = cols
        self.grid = {}

        if cell_factory is None:
            # Default factory uses basic Cell
            cell_factory = lambda r, c: Cell(r, c)

        self.cell_factory = cell_factory

        # Build cells
        for r in range(rows):
            for c in range(cols):
                self.grid[(r, c)] = self.cell_factory(r, c)

        # Link neighbors
        self.configure_neighbors()

    def configure_neighbors(self):
        for (r, c), cell in self.grid.items():
            neighbors = {}
            if (r - 1, c) in self.grid:
                neighbors["N"] = self.grid[(r - 1, c)]
            if (r + 1, c) in self.grid:
                neighbors["S"] = self.grid[(r + 1, c)]
            if (r, c - 1) in self.grid:
                neighbors["W"] = self.grid[(r, c - 1)]
            if (r, c + 1) in self.grid:
                neighbors["E"] = self.grid[(r, c + 1)]
            cell.neighbors = neighbors
```

---

### Example subclasses

```python
class WallCell(Cell):
    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Wall({self.row},{self.col})"

class PathCell(Cell):
    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Path({self.row},{self.col})"
```

---

### Usage with a rule

```python
def my_cell_factory(r, c):
    if (r + c) % 2 == 0:
        return WallCell(r, c)
    else:
        return PathCell(r, c)

g = Grid(3, 3, cell_factory=my_cell_factory)
print(g.grid)
```

**Output:**

```
{(0,0): Wall(0,0), (0,1): Path(0,1), (0,2): Wall(0,2),
 (1,0): Path(1,0), (1,1): Wall(1,1), (1,2): Path(1,2),
 (2,0): Wall(2,0), (2,1): Path(2,1), (2,2): Wall(2,2)}
```

---

## 2. Pass a **layout map**

Sometimes you want the grid layout defined explicitly (e.g. from a file or string).

```python
layout = [
    "WWW",
    "W.P",
    "PPP"
]

def layout_factory(r, c):
    char = layout[r][c]
    if char == "W":
        return WallCell(r, c)
    elif char == "P":
        return PathCell(r, c)
    else:
        return Cell(r, c)
        
g2 = Grid(3, 3, cell_factory=layout_factory)
print(g2.grid)
```

---

‚úÖ This gives you full flexibility:

* Uniform grid ‚Üí pass a `cell_class`.
* Mixed grid ‚Üí pass a `cell_factory`.
* Map-based grid ‚Üí parse from layout string / file.

---

Do you want me to also show how to **export the grid back into a text map** (like ASCII art) so you can visualize the different cell types easily?
