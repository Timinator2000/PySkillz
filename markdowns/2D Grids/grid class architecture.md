Nice ðŸ˜ƒ â€” now weâ€™re talking about **heterogeneous grids**, where different positions may have different types of `Cell`.

There are two clean ways to do this:

---

## 1. Pass a **cell factory function**

Instead of just passing a class, let the `Grid` take a function that returns a cell. This function can decide *per row,col* which subclass to use.

```python
class Grid:
    def __init__(self, rows, cols, cell_factory=None):
        self.rows = rows
        self.cols = cols
        self.grid = {}

        if cell_factory is None:
            # Default factory uses basic Cell
            cell_factory = lambda r, c: Cell(r, c)

        self.cell_factory = cell_factory

        # Build cells
        for r in range(rows):
            for c in range(cols):
                self.grid[(r, c)] = self.cell_factory(r, c)

        # Link neighbors
        self.configure_neighbors()

    def configure_neighbors(self):
        for (r, c), cell in self.grid.items():
            neighbors = {}
            if (r - 1, c) in self.grid:
                neighbors["N"] = self.grid[(r - 1, c)]
            if (r + 1, c) in self.grid:
                neighbors["S"] = self.grid[(r + 1, c)]
            if (r, c - 1) in self.grid:
                neighbors["W"] = self.grid[(r, c - 1)]
            if (r, c + 1) in self.grid:
                neighbors["E"] = self.grid[(r, c + 1)]
            cell.neighbors = neighbors
```

---

### Example subclasses

```python
class WallCell(Cell):
    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Wall({self.row},{self.col})"

class PathCell(Cell):
    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Path({self.row},{self.col})"
```

---

### Usage with a rule

```python
def my_cell_factory(r, c):
    if (r + c) % 2 == 0:
        return WallCell(r, c)
    else:
        return PathCell(r, c)

g = Grid(3, 3, cell_factory=my_cell_factory)
print(g.grid)
```

**Output:**

```
{(0,0): Wall(0,0), (0,1): Path(0,1), (0,2): Wall(0,2),
 (1,0): Path(1,0), (1,1): Wall(1,1), (1,2): Path(1,2),
 (2,0): Wall(2,0), (2,1): Path(2,1), (2,2): Wall(2,2)}
```

---

## 2. Pass a **layout map**

Sometimes you want the grid layout defined explicitly (e.g. from a file or string).

```python
layout = [
    "WWW",
    "W.P",
    "PPP"
]

def layout_factory(r, c):
    char = layout[r][c]
    if char == "W":
        return WallCell(r, c)
    elif char == "P":
        return PathCell(r, c)
    else:
        return Cell(r, c)
        
g2 = Grid(3, 3, cell_factory=layout_factory)
print(g2.grid)
```

---

âœ… This gives you full flexibility:

* Uniform grid â†’ pass a `cell_class`.
* Mixed grid â†’ pass a `cell_factory`.
* Map-based grid â†’ parse from layout string / file.

---

Do you want me to also show how to **export the grid back into a text map** (like ASCII art) so you can visualize the different cell types easily?
