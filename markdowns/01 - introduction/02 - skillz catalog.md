# Topic Catalog

__Welcome to the PySkillz Topic Catalog__

Whether you're just starting your Python journey or looking to sharpen your skills through hands-on practice, you're in the right place. This catalog is your roadmap through the PySkillz platform — a collection of carefully designed, interactive coding exercises grouped by skill level and purpose.

We’ve organized the exercises into four major categories to help you grow step-by-step:

__For the Brand New Beginner__

New to coding? You're not alone — and you're absolutely in the right place.

This section is designed for absolute beginners, and it works hand-in-hand with two excellent learning resources:

* Coding for Kids: Python by Adrienne B. Tacke

* Python Programming for the Humanities by Folgert Karsdorp

These resources do the heavy lifting when it comes to teaching you the core concepts of Python, step by step. PySkillz steps in to give you immediate, hands-on practice through bite-sized interactive exercises that match the material covered in each chapter or concept.

We focus on learning by doing, so whether you're a student, a curious adult, or a total beginner from any background, you'll get to reinforce what you've learned with real coding practice — no setup required.

__Skill Building__

Once you're comfortable with the basics, this section helps you strengthen your Python skills with focused practice. Each set targets a specific topic like loops, functions, or working with data.

__Multi-Skill Exercises__

Ready to combine what you’ve learned? These exercises challenge you to solve more complex problems using multiple Python concepts together — just like real-world coding.

__Challenge Paths__

These are more than just standalone exercises — they’re carefully structured paths that break down a more complex problem into 3 to 4 progressive steps. Each step builds on the last, helping you apply multiple Python skills in a thoughtful, guided way. By the end of each path, you'll have solved a meaningful challenge — and grown as a problem-solver.
