# Exercise #1: Start to Finish

Create a function that prints all numbers between, and including the two numbers given.

[Start to Finish]({"stubs": ["loops-basic/start_to_finish.py"], "command": "python3 loops-basic/start_to_finish_test.py"})


# Exercise #2: Start to Finish on One Line

Create a function that prints all numbers between, and including the two numbers given, on a single line.

[Start to Finish on One Line]({"stubs": ["loops-basic/start_to_finish_one_line.py"], "command": "python3 loops-basic/start_to_finish_one_line_test.py"})


# Exercise #3: Number Triangle


[Number Triangle]({"stubs": ["loops-basic/number_triangle.py"], "command": "python3 loops-basic/number_triangle_test.py"})


# Exercise #4: Sum Numbers from Start to Finish


[Start to Finish Sum]({"stubs": ["loops-basic/start_to_finish_sum.py"], "command": "python3 loops-basic/start_to_finish_sum_test.py"})


# Exercise #5: Divisible by 5

 Given a list of integers, iterate over the list and display the numbers which are divisible by 5. If you find a number greater than 150, stop the loop iteration immediately before printing anything more.

[Divisible by 5]({"stubs": ["loops-basic/divisible_by_5.py"], "command": "python3 loops-basic/divisible_by_5_test.py"})
